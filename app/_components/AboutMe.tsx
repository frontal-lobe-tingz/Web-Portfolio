    "Nothing is ever truly hardâ€”it just needs more time to understand." 
    This simple yet powerful idea became my personal motto during my development journey
    at university. It taught me patience, resilience, and the importance of persistence when 
    tackling complex problems. Every bug, every challenge became a puzzle waiting to be solved,
    and over time, I learned that growth as a developer comes not from avoiding difficulty, 
    but from embracing it.
